Need to find better way to design the class structures

Tue Aug 4 16:48:24 2015
Use standard library to store the parameters so we can remove the host_param
and device_param classes

Tue Aug  4 16:35:02 2015
Now I made up my mind, the class of host_parameters and device_parameters
shall be inherited from the unsorted_map. Because we always need some
self-defined methods.

Now stick to the individual classes for both the host parameters and device
parameters, but had a more clever way to deal with the parameters

if we don't think about the recovery and recording mode at the beginning, then
the program is first gonna be divided by policy (models), and we will check if
there are anything that can be shared.
Also we need to find a way to use as little .cu files as possible.

There is no way to do forward declaration of std containers

Thu Aug 20 23:27:22 2015
The recording file shall store the table directly with each row containing k
elements and we have k^(m-1) rows in total

Tue Aug 25 02:56:23 2015
Use assert to handle all the abnormal situations. Make the conversion in progress
but still need to find a better way to deal with the run time errors

Should carefully defined the meaning of k and m, are they included or not in the
range of the value they represented
Currently I am taking it as not, which means there are only m dimensions in this
problem including 0, and the highest dimension is m - 1

Shall store all the options as numbers instead of simply char array

Fri Aug 28 02:59:00 2015
For the options I think it would be much better if we use the defined macros in
the header file instead of just simple strings!!!! After all, all those strings
are just for coding convenience
