Need to find better way to design the class structures

Use standard library to store the parameters so we can remove the host_param
and device_param classes

Now I made up my mind, the class of host_parameters and device_parameters
shall be inherited from the unsorted_map. Because we always need some
self-defined methods.

Now stick to the individual classes for both the host parameters and device
parameters, but had a more clever way to deal with the parameters
